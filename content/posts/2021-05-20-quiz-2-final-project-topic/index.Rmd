### **Final Project Proposal**

<span style = "color: #ccefdb;">**Question 1:** *What particular research questions would you like to answer in your final project report?*</span>

My topic for the final project is the ecology of the area around Mt. St. Helens. I would like to investigate how the eruption of 1980 directly impacted the area and how vegetation has been restored and wildlife re-inhabited over time. I may also map out the immediate area to determine the extent of the volcanoâ€™s destruction and visualize the recovery.

<span style = "color: #ccefdb;">**Question 2:** *What sources do you think you can utilize to create your own data sets to answer your research questions listed in Q.1 for the final report?*</span>
