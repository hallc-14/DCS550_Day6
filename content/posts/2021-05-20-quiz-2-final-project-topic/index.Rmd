### **Final Project Proposal**

<span style = "color: #ccefdb;">**Question 1:** *What particular research questions would you like to answer in your final project report?*</span>

My final project topic is bicycle crashes in North Carolina. I plan to review factors such as age, location, road conditions, etc. to investigate for correlation and determine the most crucial factors that may lead to an accident.

<span style = "color: #ccefdb;">**Question 2:** *What sources do you think you can utilize to create your own data sets to answer your research questions listed in Q.1 for the final report?*</span>
