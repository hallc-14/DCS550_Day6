<h3><strong>Final Project Proposal</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #57cc8a;"><strong>Question 1:</strong> <em>What particular research questions would you like to answer in your final project report?</em></span></p>
<p>My topic for the final project is the ecology of the area around Mt. St. Helens. I would like to investigate how the eruption of 1980 directly impacted the area and how vegetation has been restored and wildlife re-inhabited over time. I may also map out the immediate area to determine the extent of the volcano’s destruction and visualize the recovery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #57cc8a;"><strong>Question 2:</strong> <em>What sources do you think you can utilize to create your own data sets to answer your research questions listed in Q.1 for the final report?</em></span></p>
